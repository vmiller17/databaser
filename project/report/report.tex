% The report should contain:
% 1. A cover sheet with the name of the project, your names, education programs, and e-mail addresses. You must check mail to these addresses regularly.
%    Also give the date of submission and complete instructions for running your program.
% 2. An introduction (what the project is about, etc.).
% 3. Something about requirements that you fulfill or don’t fulfill.
% 4. An outline of your system (which database manager you use, which programs you have
%    written, how the programs communicate with the database, etc.).
% 5. An E/R diagram which describes the system.
% 6. Relations. Indicate primary keys, possibly secondary keys, and foreign keys. You must
%    show that the relations are normalized according to your chosen normal form (if a relation “obviously” is in BCNF you may say so,
%    provided that you  justify your statement). If a relation is in a lower normal form than BCNF, you must justify this choice.
% 7. SQL statements to create all tables, views, stored procedures, and other database elements.
%    (Don’t include statements to create the initial contents of the database.)
% 8. A user’s manual (not necessary if everything in the program is self-explanatory).
