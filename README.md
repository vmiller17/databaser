Krusty Kookie
=============

This project is a part of the LTH course EDA216 - Database technology, and our task is to implement a system for production of cookies for the fictive company Krusty Kookies. The system is built using PHP, PDO and MySQL. The user interacts with the system using a web interface.

To test the system, just follow the steps below:

1. Unzip the folder phproot.tar.gz.
2. Open a terminal emulator and navigate into the folder.
3. Run the following command: 'php -S 127.0.0.1:8080'
4. Open a web browser, and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080

Modifications to the tables, adding new tuples etc is performed using mysql. In a terminal, run 'mysql -h db30 -p -h puccini.cs.lth.se db30', using the login credentials found in the file 'mysql_connect_data.inc.php'.

If anything is unclear, please refer to the attached project report.
