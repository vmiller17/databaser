% The report should contain:
% 1. A cover sheet with the name of the project, your names, education programs, and e-mail addresses. You must check mail to these addresses regularly.
%    Also give the date of submission and complete instructions for running your program.
% 2. An introduction (what the project is about, etc.).
% 3. Something about requirements that you fulfill or don’t fulfill.
% 4. An outline of your system (which database manager you use, which programs you have
%    written, how the programs communicate with the database, etc.).
% 5. An E/R diagram which describes the system.
% 6. Relations. Indicate primary keys, possibly secondary keys, and foreign keys. You must
%    show that the relations are normalized according to your chosen normal form (if a relation “obviously” is in BCNF you may say so,
%    provided that you  justify your statement). If a relation is in a lower normal form than BCNF, you must justify this choice.
% 7. SQL statements to create all tables, views, stored procedures, and other database elements.
%    (Don’t include statements to create the initial contents of the database.)
% 8. A user’s manual (not necessary if everything in the program is self-explanatory).

\section*{Introduction}
\section*{Requirements}
Even though the requirements were a bit diffuse (as intended) we are fairly confident that we have met all of them. 
\section*{Outline of the System}
The system is constructed in a way much similar to the system in lab 4. 
The database manager MySQL is used to manage the database, located on \url{puccini.cs.lth.se}. 
The creation and population of the database is performed by sourcing the file \textbf{tables.sql}, the creation is described in listing \ref{tables.sql}.

The factory interface is a web page written in PHP. 
The php tool PDO was used to establish a connection to the database. 
The PHP class \textbf{database.inc.php} handles everything related to the SQL database, and the PHP class \textbf{pallet.inc.php} is used to transmit data from the database class to the webpage.



The interface consists of X views. tk explain them

\section*{Relations}
The following relations were the basis for creating the database:

\section*{SQL Statements}
The following SQL statements were used to create the database:

\lstinputlisting[label={tables.sql},caption={tables.sql},lastline=83]{../tables.sql}
\section*{User's manual}
We consider the system self--explanatory enough not to require an user manual. 
The system has, in fact, been tested on a med--student with great success.
The only things worth pointing out are that:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item This thing
  \item This thing
  \item And this thing
\end{enumerate}
